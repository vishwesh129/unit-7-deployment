Ensure that : 
1. Don't hardcode the port number, instead keep a PORT key in env and use that
2. npm start/npm run start is what is used most of the times by default - 
    a) Always have a script in package.json with the key "dev" (instead of keeping the key as "server" etc though it'll work locally)
    b) The value should be "node index.js"
3. Ensure that your backend code folder is outside the masai/any organisation repo in your computer and push it to your own personal repo
4. Create a new git repo, initialise git in your folder, and add the origin
5. Ignore node_modules and .env while pushing your code to github by using .gitignore
6. Ensure that all your environment variables are provided correctly/exactly to your deployment provider like cyclic etc
